## Setup

Install both packages. `npm i` and `cd server && npm i`

## Concurrently run API and front-end;

Run `npm run dev` to start front-end server and api server concurrently. Access application at http://localhost:4200/

## Front-End Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Server
Located in /server

Run `npm run start:api` to start on port 5001.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
